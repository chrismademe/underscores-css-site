So this started out life, just a few days ago, as a pattern library. I don't think that's the right direction though. Not for this package anyway.

I spent a couple of days thinking about how to expose configuration for the components before coming to realise that that approach makes no sense. Why am I abstracting CSS inside CSS?

So, instead of shipping a full pattern library, I think I'm going to publish just the bare essentials. The things you'll likely use on every project.

## What's included?

Some standard tokens, accessible components, utilities and Sass helpers. Everything is upto you.

### Design Tokens

A set of sensible defaults, which you can extend or override.

### Components

Useful things like `flow`, `auto-grid` and some accessible custom `radio` and `checkbox`.

### Utilities

Based on your design tokens, some useful utility classes.

### Sass Helpers

Helpers for effortlessly generating utility classes among other useful things
