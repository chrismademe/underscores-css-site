Underscores.css is Sass under the hood, so you'll need a build step somewhere in your setup.

To get going, install the package via NPM:

```bash
npm install underscores-css --save
```

### Quick Start

If you want to get going quickly, using the default tokens and utility classes, you can pull it in from a CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/underscores-css/dist/underscores.css" />
```
